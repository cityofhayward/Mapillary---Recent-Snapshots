# Mapillary-Recent-Snapshots
A map viewer to see coverage of recent Mapillary photos. Filterable by latest 3, 6, or 12 month period.

Built as just a quick tool to find what areas need new photos. If you see gaps, you need photos. Supplements our program to take street level imagery for Mapillary with cameras on our street sweepers.
